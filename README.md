# PythonGames
A little collection of python games

Run Games.py to start the program 

Number guesser works like wordle with numbers it takes a string of six numbers green means its in the rightspot yellow means its in the wrong spot and red means its not in the number

all of the games currently just save the wins and losses to file and restart the game

everything else should be fairly self explanitory
